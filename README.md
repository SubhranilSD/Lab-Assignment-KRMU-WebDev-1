# My Portfolio Website  

This is my first portfolio project for Web Dev Lab. I made it using only **HTML** (no CSS or JavaScript yet). The main idea was to learn how to structure a webpage properly with semantic tags.  

## What I Did
- Created the basic layout with `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.  
- Added a **hero section** with a welcome message.  
- Wrote an **About Me** section with a profile picture and a short bio.  
- Made a **Projects** section listing 2–3 sample projects.  
- Added a **Skills table** showing my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Built a **Contact form** with fields for name, email, and message (all with labels, placeholders, and required attributes).  
- Added a **skip link** for accessibility so users can jump straight to the main content.  

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Use the navigation menu at the top to move between sections.  
3. Try filling out the form (it doesn’t send anywhere yet since there’s no backend).
